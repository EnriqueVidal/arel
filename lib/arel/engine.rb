  # this file is currently just a hack to adapt between activerecord::base which holds the connection specification
  # and active relation. ultimately, this file should be in effect what the connection specification is in active record;
  # that is: a spec of the database (url, password, etc.), a quoting adapter layer, and a connection pool.
